# Zeplin

Various tasks were given through zeplin:

To create a UI using HTML and CSS. The UI should be the same replica as given.

While working on this: 
1. Various importance of flex-box was understood and how to use these and when to use this was totally understood. Now I am familiar with the flex-box concepts.
2. How to start and the progress to keep going was learn't.

In this repo:
It would much fit for the one's to learn the UI using HTML and CSS alone. After going through this repository you will also be familiar with flex-box property. 

For the people to know how to breakdown the pages will also get help if you walk through.

Flex-box importance is clearly shown and depicted in the pages. It also helps to grow your way of thinking while working on UI.

If you want to run these pages in your local system:

Clone this repo on your system:
```
git clone https://github.com/saurabhnk-94/zeplin.git
```
There are two UI pages in the master:
Go to any browser and in url field paste the path of html pages.
1. airbnr.html
2. zeplin.html

There is a page in the video folder, copy the path of video.html and paste it in the url field. 

There you go!!!
